# Extend Data Sources Prompt

I'm working with the BentoXGBoost project and I want to extend it with a new data source. I have the following requirements:

- I want to add support for: [NEW_DATA_SOURCE_TYPE]
- The data source has the following characteristics:
  - [CHARACTERISTIC_1]
  - [CHARACTERISTIC_2]
  - [CHARACTERISTIC_3]
- I want to be able to configure the data source with the following parameters:
  - [PARAMETER_1]: [DESCRIPTION_1]
  - [PARAMETER_2]: [DESCRIPTION_2]
  - [PARAMETER_3]: [DESCRIPTION_3]
- I want to integrate this with the existing project configuration system
- I want to update the documentation to include information about the new data source

Please help me:

1. Extend the `data_loader.py` module to support the new data source
2. Update the `data_processor.py` module to process data from the new source
3. Modify the `save_model.py` script to handle the new data source
4. Update the `service.py` file to support the new data source
5. Update the `config.yaml` file to include an example project using the new data source
6. Update the README.md to include information about the new data source

I'm familiar with the project structure, which includes:
- `data_loader.py` for downloading and processing data from different sources
- `data_processor.py` for processing the data for XGBoost
- `save_model.py` for training models
- `service.py` for serving models
- `config.yaml` for project configurations
- `config_manager.py` for managing project configurations

Thank you!
