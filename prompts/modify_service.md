# Modify Service Prompt

I'm working with the BentoXGBoost project and I want to modify the service to add new functionality. I have the following requirements:

- I want to add a new API endpoint that: [ENDPOINT_DESCRIPTION]
- The endpoint should accept the following parameters:
  - [PARAMETER_1]: [DESCRIPTION_1]
  - [PARAMETER_2]: [DESCRIPTION_2]
  - [PARAMETER_3]: [DESCRIPTION_3]
- The endpoint should return: [RETURN_DESCRIPTION]
- I want to integrate this with the existing project configuration system
- I want to update the documentation to include information about the new endpoint

Please help me:

1. Modify the `service.py` file to add the new API endpoint
2. Show me how to test the new endpoint
3. Update the README.md to include information about the new endpoint
4. Create an example script that demonstrates how to use the new endpoint

I'm familiar with the project structure, which includes:
- `service.py` for the BentoML service
- `config.yaml` for project configurations
- `config_manager.py` for managing project configurations
- README.md for documentation
- `examples/` directory for example scripts

Thank you!
