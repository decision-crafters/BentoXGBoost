# Debug Issues Prompt

I'm working with the BentoXGBoost project and I'm encountering the following issue:

[DETAILED_DESCRIPTION_OF_ISSUE]

Here's what I've tried so far:
- [STEP_1]
- [STEP_2]
- [STEP_3]

Here's the error message or unexpected behavior I'm seeing:
```
[ERROR_MESSAGE_OR_BEHAVIOR_DESCRIPTION]
```

I'm using the following environment:
- Operating System: [OS]
- Python version: [PYTHON_VERSION]
- BentoML version: [BENTOML_VERSION]
- XGBoost version: [XGBOOST_VERSION]

Please help me:

1. Diagnose the issue
2. Suggest potential solutions
3. Provide step-by-step instructions to fix the issue
4. Explain how to verify that the issue is resolved

I'm familiar with the project structure, which includes:
- `data_loader.py` for downloading and processing data from different sources
- `data_processor.py` for processing the data for XGBoost
- `save_model.py` for training models
- `service.py` for serving models
- `config.yaml` for project configurations
- `config_manager.py` for managing project configurations

Thank you!
