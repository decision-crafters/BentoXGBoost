# Serve Model Prompt

I'm working with the BentoXGBoost project and I want to serve a model and interact with the API. I have the following requirements:

- I want to serve a model with the name: [MODEL_NAME]
- I want to use the project: [PROJECT_NAME] (if applicable)
- I want to interact with the API to:
  - Make predictions
  - List available models
  - Switch between models
  - Get information about the current model
  - List available projects
  - Switch between projects

Please help me:

1. Show me the command to start the BentoML service with the specific model or project
2. Show me examples of how to interact with the API using curl or Python
3. Explain how to make predictions with the model
4. Show me how to switch between different models or projects
5. Explain how to get information about the current model or project

I'm familiar with the project structure, which includes:
- `service.py` for the BentoML service
- `config.yaml` for project configurations
- Makefile with commands for working with the service

Thank you!
