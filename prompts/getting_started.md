# Getting Started Prompt

I'm new to the BentoXGBoost project and I want to get started with it. Please help me understand:

1. What is the BentoXGBoost project and what does it do?
2. How is the project structured and what are the main components?
3. How do I set up the project and install the dependencies?
4. How do I train a model using the default dataset?
5. How do I train a model using a custom data source (GitHub repository, web page, or crawled website)?
6. How do I serve a model and interact with the API?
7. How do I use the project configuration system to manage different projects?
8. What are the available Make commands and how do I use them?

Please provide step-by-step instructions and examples for each of these questions. I'm a [BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED] developer with experience in [RELEVANT_TECHNOLOGIES].

Thank you!
